# vaadin-elements-demo
Step-by-step demo application of Vaadin Elements with Sinatra.

# Step 1
We start with a simple _hello, world_ application.

# Step 2
We move the view to an erb file and render it.

# Step 3
We add some backend data and create a basic layout for the application.

# Step 4
We introduce `Gemfile` and make the app runnable through `Rack`. Also, we import the required gems.

# Step 5
In this step we import `vaadin-elements` gem and put empty Elements in the view.

# Step 6
Here we set up two combo-boxes with predefined data and assign them ids.

# Step 7
We set up the third combo-box and use custom label and value for the items.
